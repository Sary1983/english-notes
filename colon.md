### Semi-colons are often confused with colons; however, the two perform completely different tasks. 

A colon means "that is to say" or "here's what I mean."

Generally, it is a method of **INTRODUCING** a list or an example whilse a semi-colon is meant to join sentences.

## THe Rules

1) Use a colon to introduce a series of items. DO not capitalize the first item after the colon unless its a proper noun.

`Examples` -> 
You may be required to bring many things: sleeping bags, pans, utensils, and warm clothing. 

I want the following items: butter, sugar, and flour. 

I need an aassistant who can do the following: input data, write reports, and complete tax forms. 

2) Avoid using a colon before a list when the sentence already includes an introduction to the list. 

- Incorrect: I need a few things from the store, such as: butter, sugar, and flour.
- "such as" is being used for the same purpose as the colon in this example.

- Correct I need a few things from the store: butter, sugar, and flour. / I need a few things from the store, such as butter, sugar, and flour.
