# Dashes
### Dashes, like commas, semicolons, colons, ellipses, and parenthesis, indicate added emphasis, an interruption, or an abrupt change of thought. Experienced writers know these marks are not interchangeable.

- `Note how dashes subtly change the tone of the following sentences`

- **YOu are the friend, the only friend, who offered to help me.**
- YOu are the friend(**em dash**)the only friend(**em dash**)who offered to help me. **(Double Dash)**

- **I pay the bills; she has all the fun.**
- I pay the bills(**em dash**)she has all the run.

Both sets of examples, neither is wrong. The dash in this case is used for emphasis in place of either the commas or the semi-colons.
