# Dashes
### Dashes, like commas, semicolons, colons, ellipses, and parenthesis, indicate added emphasis, an interruption, or an abrupt change of thought. Experienced writers know these marks are not interchangeable.

- `Note how dashes subtly change the tone of the following sentences`

- **YOu are the friend, the only friend, who offered to help me.**
- YOu are the friend(**em dash**)the only friend(**em dash**)who offered to help me. **(Double Dash)**

- **I pay the bills; she has all the fun.**
- I pay the bills(**em dash**)she has all the run.

Both sets of examples, neither is wrong. The dash in this case is used for emphasis in place of either the commas or the semi-colons.

## The Rules

1) Words and phrases between dashes are not generally part of the subject. Think of it in the sense as an interruption.

__Example:__ Joe - and his trusty mutt - was always welcome.
Joe and his trusty mutt were always welcome.

- One thing to remember is that the information between the dashes can pretty much be ignored and the rest of the sentence would still make sense.

2) The dash can take the place of a colon if you want added emphasis.

__Without Dash__: THere is one thing I hate above all else: spiders!
__With Dash:__ There is one thing I hate above all else - spiders!

3) Dashes replace otherwise mandatory punctuation, such as the commas after Iowa and 2013 in the following examples:
 - __Without Dash__ The man from Ames, Iowa, arrived.
 - __With Dash__ THe man(**em dash**)he was from AMes, Iowa(**em dash**)arrived.
 - __WIthout Dash__ THe may 1, 2013, edition of the Ames Sentinel arrived in June.
 - __With Dash__ The AMes Sentinel(**em dash**)dates May 1, 2013(**em dash**)arrived in june.
