## Semi COlons

Semi-colons indicate an audible plause. SLightly longer than a comma, but short of the period's full stop. 

- Avoid using semicolons in place of semicolons
`Correct` I have on goal: to find her.
`Incorrect` I have one goal; to find her.

# The Rules

1) A semi-colon can replace a period if the writer wishes to narrow the gap between two closely linked sentences.

`Examples` ->
- Call me tomorrow; you can give me answer then.
- We have paid our dues; we expect all the privileges listed in the contract.
