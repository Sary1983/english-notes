# The Rules

1) A semi-colon can replace a period if the writer wishes to narrow the gap between two closely linked sentences.

`Examples` ->
- Call me tomorrow; you can give me answer then.
- We have paid our dues; we expect all the privileges listed in the contract.

2) Use a semicolon when you join two sentences together with one of the following conjuctive adverbs (these are known as transitional phrases **however, moreover, therefore, otherwise**). You can also use a comma before these.

`Example` -> 
- Bring any two items; however, sleeping bags and tents are in short supply.
- There are many stressors students are facing today; therefore, it is important for them to find balance in life between work and play.

### if you use a semi-colon to join two sentences and there is a transistional phrase, you must include a comma after the phrase.

3) Use a semicolon to separate units of a series when one or more of the units contain commas. 

`Incorrect` - THe conference has people that come from moscow, idaho, springfield, california, alamo, tennessee, and other places as well. 
`COrrect` - THe conference has people who have come from Moscow, Idaho; Springfield, California; Alamo, Tennessee; and other places as well.
