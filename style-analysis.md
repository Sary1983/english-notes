# The FOur Elements of Style:

## What is Style?
- Every author has their own style - that is, each author uses literary devices in a particular way that makes their writing recognizable.
- When you read several books by the same author, you become accustomed to the author's style of writing and sometimes you look for authors with a similar style.

### A writer's stlye is what sets their writing apart and makes it unique. Style is the way writing is dressed up to fit the context, purpose or audience. Word choice, sentence fluency, and the writer's voice all contribute to the style of a piece of writing.

1) Figure out the author's point of view as it can affect the other style of elements. For example, a first person point of view would add a personalized perspective, whereas a third person limited would detach the author from the writing.

### point of views
**first person** (I, me, my) - I went to the store today. While there, I bumped into an old friend.
\n **second person** (you instructions/directions) - You should work on getting your room cleaned. First, pick up all the clothes.
\n **third person - imited** (he, she, it, they, them, told through one character) - He could tell from the expression on her face what he had said upset her.
\n **thid person omniscient** (all knowing; all character thoguhts are revealed) - Sara ignored jamie and coontinued to gaze at the stars.

2) Determine if the diction is it is formal or casual. This will help display the author's purpose.
