## What is Style?
- Every author has their own style - that is, each author uses literary devices in a particular way that makes their writing recognizable.
- When you read several books by the same author, you become accustomed to the author's style of writing and sometimes you look for authors with a similar style.

### A writer's stlye is what sets their writing apart and makes it unique. Style is the way writing is dressed up to fit the context, purpose or audience. Word choice, sentence fluency, and the writer's voice all contribute to the style of a piece of writing.
